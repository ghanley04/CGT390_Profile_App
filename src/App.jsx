    and I am working towards a minor in Computer Science. I love creating websites, and
    love learning as much as I can about them. I am originally from St. Louis, MO, but my family lives in Gainsville, GA. I have three
    siblings, one older sister, and a younger brother and sister. We also have two teenage cats, Scooter and Habibi
    (Habibi is a little plump, and Scooter is the enegetic one). I love playing frisbee at Purdue, crocheting, and getting a good sweet treat
    whenever I can. </div>
